ePyTox
======

A Python toolkit for environmental toxicology model fitting and simulations. At
present, mainly a demonstration of using Python for numerical ecotox modelling.

* Supports the GUTS-IT and GUTS-SD models [1]
* Find optimal model parameters by maximizing the likelihood
* Profile the likelihood function
* Sample from the posterior using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

The heavy lifting is done by the scipy, lmfit and emcee packages. Additionally,
matplotlib, pandas, corner, tqdm and seaborn is used.
